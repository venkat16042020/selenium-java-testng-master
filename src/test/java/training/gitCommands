              better we can make sure, having the lastest code like remote repo.
git push origin branch99

incase of merge conflicts...
1. git merge --abort: to abort the merge happening from remote repo.
2. If we want to push our local change to remote means:
              resolve merge conflicts and again commit the code after resolving merge conflicts.
